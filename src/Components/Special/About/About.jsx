          Hello! I'm Arpan Rakshit, a passionate front-end developer and UI/UX designer with a keen eye for detail. 
          I specialize in creating visually stunning and user-friendly web experiences. 
          With a strong foundation in modern web technologies and design principles, 
          I strive to bring creative ideas to life in the most elegant way possible.

        <p className="about-paragraph">
          My journey in web development began with a love for creating and problem-solving. Over the years, 
          I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks to build responsive and dynamic websites. 
          I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft, and I'm excited about the ever-evolving 
          landscape of web development.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, reading tech blogs, and experimenting with 
          different creative mediums. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
